# hello-world
The starting road to github.

I'd like to practice the Q-learning method in programs.

I'm trying to make some edits on the branch of master which branch is called as readme-bits.
By choosing the copied file 'README.md' and clicking the pencil icon, I'm able to make changes in this code file.
